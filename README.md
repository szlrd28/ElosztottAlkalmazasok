There are workers in a building who are either janitors or producers.

We know the name and salary of every employee.

We know the janitor's shift, we know the producer's profession.

Workers should be copyable.

The list of employees can be retrieved from the building by default by name, but also sorted by salary.

The building archives its attendees in a binary file on a daily basis.

When a building is "created", it updates itself if there is an existing binary.
